      <title>Ingesting log files to sqlite</title>

      <description>I recently was looking into how to analyze multiple related log files (e.g. application log from multiple instances), and found that sqlite may be enough :)&#xA;The first step is ingesting content from log files into sqlite tables. sqlite-utils to the rescue! I was initially happy with having each line as a row and adding full-text support to the log column to query events. However, a Java log may span across multiple lines and the outputs may not be ideal â€” timestamps could be in 1 line, and the stack trace root cause in another one.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with Datasette and sqlite for a bit, trying to collect and expose data efficiently for others to analyze.&#xA;Recently started finding use-cases to get data from Apache Kafka, and expose it quickly to analyze it.&#xA;Why not using Datasette?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
