The first step is ingesting content from log files into sqlite tables. sqlite-utils to the rescue! I was initially happy with having each line as a row and adding full-text support to the log column to query events. However, a Java log may span across multiple lines and the outputs may not be ideal — timestamps could be in 1 line, and the stack trace root cause in another one.</description></item><item><title>Piggyback on Kafka Connect Schemas to process Kafka records in a generic way</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-08-24-kafka-connect-schema-serde/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-08-24-kafka-connect-schema-serde/</guid><description>When reading from/writing to Kafka topics, a serializer/deserializer (a.k.a SerDes) is needed to process record key and value bytes. Specific SerDes that turn bytes into specific objects (e.g. POJO) are used, unless a generic JSON object or Avro structure is used.
Kafka Connect has to deal with generic structures to apply message transformations and convert messages from external sources into Kafka records and vice-versa. It has a SchemaAndValue composed type that includes a Connect Schema type derived from Schema Registry or JSON Schema included in the payload, and a value object.</description></item><item><title>sqlite can be used document and graph database</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-05-09-sqlite-as-document-and-graph-db/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-05-09-sqlite-as-document-and-graph-db/</guid><description>I found that the use-cases for sqlite keep increasing now the JSON is supported.

With a proper Public Key Infrastructure, a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) can be available for clients to validate if a certificate is still valid regardless of its time-to-live.
For instance, if a private key has been compromised, then a certificate can be revoked before it&amp;rsquo;s valid date.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kafka Streams FK-join within the same KTable</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-29-kafka-streams-fk-join-same-table/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-29-kafka-streams-fk-join-same-table/</guid><description>&lt;p>KTable to KTable foreign-key joins is one of the coolest features in Kafka Streams.&lt;/p>

When scaled vertically, multiple tasks store multiple partitions locally.
An interesting question is whether Kafka Streams gives access when reading (i.e. &lt;a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html">Interactive Queries&lt;/a>) to these stores, and how does it manage to abstract the access to different stores managed by multiple tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>reload4j as drop-in replacement for log4j 1.x</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-25-reload4j/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-25-reload4j/</guid><description>&lt;p>TIL there is a drop-in replacement for log4j 1.x: &lt;a href="https://reload4j.qos.ch/">Reload4j&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ansible has a debug mode to pause and troubleshoot</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-21-ansible-debug/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2022-01-21-ansible-debug/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been running Ansible for a while now.
My usual/naive way of debugging has always been adding a &lt;code>debug&lt;/code> module&lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html">[1]&lt;/a>, and get the execution running til that point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured that there are better ways to deal with this&lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_debugger.html#examples">[2]&lt;/a>.
By using the debug mode, tasks will stop when failing (by default) and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to introspect into the task, variables, and context when things failed.
Even better, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to re-execute if there was a transient error.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Changing Kafka Broker's rack</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-10-kafka-change-rack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-10-kafka-change-rack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kafka broker configuration includes a &lt;code>rack&lt;/code> label to define the location of the broker.

This means by default Producers will be balanced between latency (no batching) and durability — different from previous versions where the main goal was to reduce latency even by risking durability with acks=1.</description></item><item><title>Reducing `acks` doesn't help to reduce end-to-end latency</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-09-kafka-reducing-acks-and-latency/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-09-kafka-reducing-acks-and-latency/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kafka Producers enforce durability across replicas by setting &lt;code>acks=all&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://jeqo.github.io/til/kafka-v3-idea">default since v3.0&lt;/a>).
As enforcing this guarantee requires waiting for replicas to sync, this increases latency; and reducing it tends to give the impression that latency gets reduced overall.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use min.insync.replicas for fault-tolerance</title><link>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-02-kafka-min-isr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeqo.github.io/notes/2021-12-02-kafka-min-isr/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things to remember:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Topic replication factor is not enough to guarantee fault-tolerance. If &lt;code>min.insync.replicas&lt;/code> is not defined i.e. 1, then data could potentially be lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>acks=all&lt;/code> will force replica leader to wait for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> brokers in the ISR, not only the &lt;code>min.insync.replicas&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If replicas available are equal to minimum ISR, then the topic partitions are at the edge of losing availability. If one broker becomes unavailable (e.g. restarting), then producers will fail to write data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Topic configuration is inherited from the server. If broker configuration changes, it affects the &lt;em>existing&lt;/em> topics. Keep the topic defaults, unless it needs to be different than broker default for easier maintenance.&lt;/li>
